## QS124 Statement 1: Direct Access to Diagnostic Tests

### Purpose

Enable GPs to directly access diagnostic imaging and endoscopy for patients with suspected cancer, reducing time to diagnosis through cost-effective direct referral pathways.

### Applies To

- **Service Providers:** Primary care, secondary care, and community imaging services
- **Healthcare Professionals:** GPs and practice nurses
- **Commissioners:** Clinical commissioning groups and NHS England

### Triggers / Eligibility

A patient presenting to their GP with **symptoms that may suggest cancer** requiring diagnostic investigation.

### Required Actions

1. GPs must have direct access to the following diagnostic tests:
   - Endoscopy (upper and lower GI)
   - Ultrasound
   - MRI
   - X-ray
   - CT

2. The GP retains responsibility for:
   - The patient's ongoing care
   - Following up on test results
   - Acting on the results appropriately

### Timing Requirements

Not explicitly specified for this statement. Refer to local pathway agreements for target turnaround times.

### Documentation Requirements

- Record of referral for direct access testing
- Local data collection for quality measure reporting

### Exclusions / Not Covered

- Tests ordered through 2-week-wait (2WW) suspected cancer pathways (covered separately)
- Specialist-to-specialist referrals
- Emergency presentations

### Escalation Criteria

- If direct access pathway is unavailable, escalate to local cancer pathway lead
- If symptoms meet urgent referral criteria, use 2WW pathway instead

### Quality Measures

| Type | Measure | Data Source |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Structure | Evidence of local arrangements giving GPs direct access to diagnostic endoscopy, ultrasound, MRI, X-ray, and CT for people with suspected cancer | Local data collection |
| Outcome | (a) Time to diagnostic test for suspected cancer | Local data collection |
| Outcome | (b) Time from presentation at GP to cancer diagnosis | Local data collection |

### Definitions

**Direct Access:** When a person is referred directly by their GP for a test in a specialist service and the GP retains responsibility for the person's care, including following up and acting on the results. *(Adapted from NICE guideline on suspected cancer)*

### Data Sources

- Local data collection systems
- GP practice records
- Diagnostic service appointment logs

### Common Failure Modes

1. **Lack of pathway awareness:** GPs unaware direct access is available for certain tests. *(Inferred)*
2. **Incomplete follow-up:** Results returned but not actioned due to unclear responsibility. *(Inferred)*
3. **Pathway bottlenecks:** Insufficient capacity in diagnostic services leading to delays. *(Inferred)*

## QS124 Statement 2: Urgent Direct Access Endoscopy for Oesophageal or Stomach Cancer

### Purpose

Ensure patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of oesophageal or stomach cancer receive urgent upper GI endoscopy through a direct access pathway, enabling faster diagnosis and earlier treatment.

### Applies To

- **Service Providers:** Primary care services and endoscopy services
- **Healthcare Professionals:** GPs and practice nurses
- **Commissioners:** Clinical commissioning groups and NHS England

### Triggers / Eligibility

Refer for **urgent direct access upper gastrointestinal endoscopy** (to be performed within 2 weeks) if the patient has:

- **Dysphagia** (difficulty swallowing), OR
- **Age 55 or over** with **weight loss** AND any of:
  - Upper abdominal pain
  - Reflux
  - Dyspepsia

### Required Actions

1. Identify patients meeting the symptom criteria above
2. Arrange urgent direct access upper GI endoscopy
3. Ensure the test is performed and results returned within 2 weeks
4. GP retains responsibility for follow-up and action on results

### Timing Requirements

| Requirement | Timeframe |
|-------------|-----------|
| Endoscopy performed | Within 2 weeks of referral |
| Results returned to GP | Within 2 weeks of referral |

### Documentation Requirements

- Record of symptoms triggering referral
- Date of referral
- Confirmation of urgent direct access pathway used
- Date of endoscopy and results received
- Actions taken on results

### Exclusions / Not Covered

- Patients not meeting the symptom criteria above
- Elective or routine endoscopy requests
- Patients presenting via emergency department

### Escalation Criteria

- If 2-week target cannot be met, escalate to endoscopy service lead
- If patient has red flag symptoms beyond criteria (e.g., GI bleeding, obstruction), consider emergency referral
- If endoscopy unavailable, escalate to alternative imaging or 2WW pathway

### Quality Measures

| Type | Measure | Data Source |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Structure | Evidence of local direct access pathways ensuring patients with symptoms suggesting oesophageal/stomach cancer receive urgent direct access upper GI endoscopy | Local data collection |
| Process | Proportion of patients with symptoms suggesting oesophageal/stomach cancer who have an urgent direct access upper GI endoscopy (Numerator: those who had endoscopy; Denominator: those sent for urgent direct access endoscopy) | Local data collection |
| Outcome | (a) Time to oesophageal cancer diagnosis | Local data collection |
| Outcome | (b) Time to stomach cancer diagnosis | Local data collection |

### Definitions

**Direct Access:** When a person is sent directly by their GP for a test in a specialist service (e.g., imaging or endoscopy), and the GP retains responsibility for the person's care, including following up and acting on the results. *(Adapted from NICE guideline on suspected cancer)*

**Urgent:** The test should be performed and results returned within 2 weeks. *(Adapted from NICE guideline on suspected cancer)*

**Symptoms Suggesting Oesophageal or Stomach Cancer:**
- Dysphagia, OR
- Age ≥55 with weight loss AND (upper abdominal pain OR reflux OR dyspepsia)

*(Adapted from NICE guideline NG12, recommendations 1.2.1 and 1.2.7)*

### Data Sources

- Local data collection systems
- Endoscopy service records
- GP referral logs

### Common Failure Modes

1. **Incomplete symptom assessment:** Missing weight loss or age criteria leading to inappropriate non-urgent referral. *(Inferred)*
2. **Pathway confusion:** Referral sent to 2WW pathway instead of direct access, adding delay.
3. **Results follow-up gap:** Endoscopy completed but results not returned or actioned within 2 weeks. *(Inferred)*
4. **Capacity constraints:** Endoscopy slots unavailable within 2-week target. *(Inferred)*

## QS124 Statement 3: Testing for Blood in Faeces

### Purpose

Identify adults at higher risk of colorectal cancer through faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) when they present with suggestive symptoms but do not meet the criteria for urgent 2-week-wait referral, enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment.

### Applies To

- **Service Providers:** Primary care services
- **Healthcare Professionals:** GPs, specialists, and practice nurses
- **Commissioners:** Clinical commissioning groups and NHS England

### Triggers / Eligibility

Offer a test for blood in faeces to adults who:

1. Present in primary care with **symptoms that suggest colorectal cancer**, AND
2. **Do NOT meet** the criteria for a suspected cancer pathway referral (2WW)

**Symptoms that suggest colorectal cancer include:**
- Weight loss (unexplained)
- Abdominal pain
- Iron-deficiency anaemia
- Changes in bowel habit

**Exclusions from this pathway (i.e., require 2WW referral instead):**
- Patients with rectal bleeding who meet 2WW criteria
- Patients meeting NICE NG12 recommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.3 for suspected cancer pathway referral

### Required Actions

1. Assess patient against 2WW referral criteria (NICE NG12, recommendations 1.3.1–1.3.3)
2. If 2WW criteria NOT met, offer faecal immunochemical test (FIT)
3. Use recommended FIT tests:
   - OC Sensor
   - HM-JACKarc
   - FOB Gold
4. Act on positive results with appropriate referral for definitive investigation

### Timing Requirements

Not explicitly specified. Follow local pathway protocols for FIT turnaround and follow-up.

### Documentation Requirements

- Record of symptom assessment
- Documentation that 2WW criteria were assessed and not met
- Record of FIT offered/performed
- FIT result and date
- Actions taken on result

### Exclusions / Not Covered

- Patients who meet 2WW suspected cancer pathway referral criteria
- Patients with visible rectal bleeding (assess for 2WW pathway)
- Patients already enrolled in NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme
- Paediatric patients (statement applies to adults only)

### Escalation Criteria

- **Positive FIT result:** Refer for definitive investigation (colonoscopy)
- **Persistent symptoms despite negative FIT:** Consider clinical review and possible referral
- **2WW criteria met at any point:** Redirect to suspected cancer pathway

### Quality Measures

| Type | Measure | Data Source |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Structure | Evidence of local arrangements and written clinical protocols ensuring adults with colorectal cancer symptoms who do not meet 2WW criteria have a FIT | Local data collection |
| Process | Proportion of adults with colorectal cancer symptoms (without visible rectal bleeding) not meeting 2WW criteria who have a FIT (Numerator: those tested; Denominator: presentations meeting criteria) | Local data collection |
| Outcome | (a) Stage of colorectal cancer at diagnosis | Local data collection |
| Outcome | (b) Colorectal cancer-related mortality | Local data collection |

### Definitions

**Adults with symptoms that suggest colorectal cancer who do not need an urgent referral:** Adults with unexplained symptoms of colorectal cancer (e.g., weight loss, abdominal pain, iron-deficiency anaemia, changes in bowel habit) who do not have rectal bleeding and do not meet the criteria for a suspected cancer pathway referral per NICE NG12 (recommendations 1.3.1–1.3.3). *(Adapted from NICE DG30 and NG12)*

**Test for blood in faeces (FIT):** A chemical test that detects tiny traces of blood in faeces. NICE recommends:
- OC Sensor
- HM-JACKarc
- FOB Gold

*(NICE diagnostics guidance DG30)*

### Data Sources

- Local data collection systems
- GP practice records
- Laboratory FIT results

### Common Failure Modes

1. **Over-reliance on negative FIT:** Symptoms persist but FIT negative; failure to escalate or re-evaluate. *(Inferred)*
2. **Inappropriate FIT use:** Offering FIT to patients who meet 2WW criteria, causing delay.
3. **Sample collection issues:** Patient does not complete FIT sample correctly; result invalid. *(Inferred)*
4. **Lost results:** FIT completed but result not returned to GP or not actioned. *(Inferred)*
5. **Threshold confusion:** Uncertainty about FIT cut-off values for referral. *(Inferred)*

## QS124 Statement 4: Encouraging Attendance at Cancer Services

### Purpose

Reduce missed appointments and ensure early diagnosis by providing patients referred to cancer services with written information that explains the referral, alleviates fears, and encourages attendance.

### Applies To

- **Service Providers:** Primary care, secondary care, and cancer services
- **Healthcare Professionals:** GPs and practice nurses
- **Commissioners:** Clinical commissioning groups and NHS England

### Triggers / Eligibility

Any patient with **suspected cancer who is referred to a cancer service** (e.g., 2WW pathway, direct access investigation).

### Required Actions

1. At the time of referral, provide the patient with **written information** covering:
   - Where they are being referred
   - How to get further information about the type of cancer
   - Potential test outcomes
   - Alternative diagnoses (reassurance that most referrals do not result in cancer diagnosis)
   - How long it will take to get a diagnosis or test results
   - Whether they can take someone with them to the appointment
   - Who to contact if they do not receive confirmation of an appointment
   - Other sources of support

2. Have a **recorded discussion** with the patient when offering the referral about information to encourage attendance

### Timing Requirements

Information must be provided **at the time the referral is offered** (i.e., during the consultation, not afterwards).

### Documentation Requirements

- Record of discussion held when referral was offered
- Record that written information was provided
- Content or reference to the information leaflet/material given

### Exclusions / Not Covered

- Emergency or inpatient referrals (where information provision may differ)
- Follow-up appointments post-diagnosis
- Non-cancer referrals

### Escalation Criteria

- If patient indicates they may not attend, escalate to senior clinician or cancer navigator for additional support
- If patient has communication needs (language, learning difficulties), arrange appropriate support *(Equality and diversity consideration)*

### Quality Measures

| Type | Measure | Data Source |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Structure | Evidence of local arrangements ensuring people with suspected cancer referred to a cancer service are given written information to encourage attendance | Local data collection |
| Process | Proportion of referrals to a cancer service with a recorded discussion when referral was offered about information to encourage attendance (Numerator: referrals with recorded discussion; Denominator: all referrals of suspected cancer to a cancer service) | Local data collection |
| Outcome | (a) Number of missed appointments | Local data collection |
| Outcome | (b) Patient satisfaction with information provided | Local data collection |
| Outcome | (c) Time to cancer diagnosis | Local data collection |

### Definitions

**Information to encourage attendance at cancer services:**
Written information covering:
- Where the patient is being referred
- How to get further information about the type of cancer
- Potential test outcomes
- Alternative diagnoses
- How long it will take to get a diagnosis or test results
- Whether they can take someone with them
- Who to contact if they do not receive appointment confirmation
- Other sources of support

*(Adapted from NICE NG12, recommendations 1.14.1, 1.14.3, and 1.14.5)*

### Data Sources

- GP practice records
- Hospital appointment attendance data
- Patient satisfaction surveys
- Cancer service referral tracking systems

### Common Failure Modes

1. **No written information provided:** Verbal discussion only, no leaflet given.
2. **Information not recorded:** Discussion held but not documented.
3. **Generic information:** Leaflet not tailored to suspected cancer type or pathway. *(Inferred)*
4. **Language/accessibility barriers:** Information not available in appropriate format or language. *(From equality and diversity considerations)*
5. **Timing failure:** Information sent by post after consultation rather than at time of referral. *(Inferred)*

---

## Equality and Diversity Considerations

Information given to a person with suspected cancer should be appropriate in terms of language and culture, because there may be different cultural meanings associated with the possibility of cancer.
