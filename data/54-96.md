# Terms used in this guideline

## Children
From birth to 15 years.

## Children and young people
From birth to 24 years.

## Consistent with
The finding has characteristics that could be caused by many things, including cancer.

## Direct access
When a test is done and primary care retain clinical responsibility throughout, including acting on the result.

## Immediate
An acute admission or referral occurring within a few hours, or even more quickly if necessary.

## Non-urgent
The timescale generally used for a referral or investigation that is not considered very urgent or urgent.

## Persistent
The continuation of specified symptoms and/or signs beyond a period that would normally be associated with self-limiting problems. The precise period will vary depending on the
severity of symptoms and associated features, as assessed by the health professional.

# Raises the suspicion of

A mass or lesion that has an appearance or a feel that makes the healthcare professional believe cancer is a significant possibility.

# Safety netting

The active monitoring in primary care of people who have presented with symptoms. It has 2 separate aspects:

- timely review and action after investigations
- active monitoring of symptoms in people at low risk (but not no risk) of having cancer to see if their risk of cancer changes.

# Suspected cancer pathway referral

Person to receive a diagnosis or ruling out of cancer within 28 days of being referred urgently by their GP for suspected cancer. For further details, see [NHS England's webpage on faster diagnosis of cancer](https://www.england.nhs.uk/cancer/faster-diagnosis/).

# Unexplained

Symptoms or signs that have not led to a diagnosis being made by the healthcare professional in primary care after initial assessment (including history, examination and any primary care investigations).

# Urgent

To happen or be done before 2 weeks.

# Very urgent

To happen within 48 hours.
# Young people

Aged 16 to 24 years.
# Recommendations for research

The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research.

## Key recommendations for research

### 1 Age thresholds in cancer

Longitudinal studies should be carried out to identify and quantify factors in adults that are associated with development of specific cancers at a younger age than the norm. They should be designed to inform age thresholds in clinical guidance. The primary outcome should be likelihood ratios and positive predictive values for cancer occurring in younger age groups.

### 2 Primary care testing

Diagnostic accuracy studies of tests accessible to primary care should be carried out for a given cancer in symptomatic people. Priority areas for research should include tests for people with cough, non-visible haematuria, suspected prostate cancer, suspected pancreatic cancer, suspected cancer in childhood and young people and other suspected rare cancers. Outcomes of interest are the performance characteristics of the test, particularly sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values.

### 3 Cancers insufficiently researched in primary care

Observational studies of symptomatic primary care patients should be used to estimate the positive predictive value of different symptoms for specific cancers. Priority areas for research are those where the evidence base is currently insufficient and should include prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, cancer in childhood and young people and other rare cancers. Outcomes of interest are positive predictive values and likelihood ratios for cancer.

### 4 Patient experience

Qualitative studies are needed to assess the key issues in patient experience and patient
information needs in the cancer diagnostic pathway, particularly in the interval between first presentation to primary care and first appointment in secondary care. Outcomes of interest are patient satisfaction, quality of life and patient perception of the quality of care and information.

# 5 Prostate-specific antigen testing

What is the diagnostic accuracy of using age-adjusted and fixed prostate-specific antigen thresholds for people with symptoms of prostate cancer, including those at high risk of developing prostate cancer (such as those with an African family background or a family history of prostate cancer)?

> For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research see the rationale section on prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer.
>
> Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: PSA testing for prostate cancer.
# Rationale and impact

This section briefly explains why the committee made the recommendation and how it might affect practice.

## Prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer

Recommendation 1.6.3

### Why the committee made the recommendation

The evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of fixed and age-specific prostate-specific antigen (PSA) thresholds was very uncertain because all of the studies were based on a population that had already been referred to secondary care. The 2019 guideline recommended referral if PSA levels were above the age-specific reference range. The committee agreed that referral should be considered based on PSA thresholds, but did not make a stronger recommendation because of the uncertainty in the evidence and the likely low positive predictive value of the PSA test for prevalence estimates based on UK population data. The committee noted that many prostate cancers are slow growing and might never impact a person's life expectancy. Some people might choose not to be referred to secondary care to avoid invasive investigations and treatment that might not benefit them. Therefore, the committee agreed that a patient-centred approach to referral is important, and recommended that the person's preferences and any comorbidities should be taken into account.

The committee agreed that more research is needed in this area to better understand the most appropriate thresholds that should prompt referral to secondary care for each age group. The committee noted that ethnicity and family history are important factors that affect the risk of prostate cancer. Therefore, they recommended that the data from research be stratified by these factors to determine whether different PSA levels should prompt referral in these groups. Research in this area may also help to address health inequalities in prostate cancer diagnosis and outcomes in the UK.

There was no strong evidence to differentiate between using age-specific or fixed PSA
thresholds. The committee also noted that no cost-effectiveness evidence comparing age-specific thresholds with fixed thresholds was identified. However, because PSA levels increase naturally with age, the committee agreed a lower fixed PSA threshold would detect more cases of prostate cancer but also lead to unnecessary biopsies and overtreatment in some age groups. This would also be likely to result in more referrals to secondary care and have a significant impact on NHS resources. The committee therefore recommended the use of age-specific thresholds, which are already established in current practice and were recommended in the previous version of the guideline. Because of regional variations in practice (particularly in the 50 to 69 age range), the committee decided to define the age-specific PSA thresholds. The committee agreed that the thresholds used in the reviewed studies on people with symptoms of possible prostate cancer should be used in the absence of evidence to support alternative values, because these studies were most applicable to the population that the recommendation applies to. No evidence was available specifically for people under 40 or over 79, and so the committee recommended that clinical judgement is used when deciding whether to refer people in these groups to secondary care.

## How the recommendation might affect practice

Referral based on age-specific PSA thresholds is already recommended, so practice should not change significantly. Also, clarifying the age-specific thresholds will help standardise care. Taking into account patient preferences and comorbidities should also lead to a more patient-centred approach to referral.

# Context

Cancer has an enormous impact, both in terms of the number of people affected by it and the individual impact it has on people with cancer and those close to them. More than 300,000 new cancers (excluding skin cancers) are diagnosed annually in the UK, across over 200 different cancer types. Each of these cancer types has different presenting features, though they sometimes overlap. Approximately one-third of the population will develop a cancer in their lifetime. There is considerable variation in referral and testing for possible cancer, which cannot be fully explained by variation in the population.

The identification of people with possible cancer usually happens in primary care, because most people first present to a primary care clinician. Therefore, evidence from primary care should inform the identification process and was used as the basis for this guideline.

The recommendations were developed using a 'risk threshold', whereby if the risk of symptoms being caused by cancer is above a certain level, then action (investigation or referral) is warranted. The positive predictive value (PPV) was used to determine the threshold. In the previous guideline, a disparate range of percentage risks of cancer was used to form the recommendations. Few corresponded with a PPV of lower than 5%. The guideline development group (GDG) felt that, in order to improve diagnosis of cancer, a PPV threshold lower than 5% was preferable. Taking into account the financial and clinical costs of broadening the recommendations, the GDG agreed to use a 3% PPV threshold value to underpin the recommendations for suspected cancer pathway referrals and urgent direct access investigations, such as brain scanning or endoscopy. Certain exceptions to a 3% PPV threshold were agreed. Recommendations were made for children and young people at below the 3% PPV threshold, although no explicit threshold value was set. The threshold was not applied to recommendations relating to tests routinely available in primary care (including blood tests such as prostate-specific antigen and imaging such as chest X-ray), primary care tests that could be used in place of specialist referral, non-urgent direct access tests and routine referrals for specialist opinion. Further information about the methods used to underpin the recommendations can be found in the full guideline.

It is well recognised that some risk factors increase the chance of a person developing cancer in the future, for example, increasing age and a family history of cancer. However, risk factors do not affect the way in which cancer presents. Of the risk factors that were reported in the evidence, only smoking (in lung cancer) and age were found to significantly
influence the chance of symptoms being predictive of cancer. Therefore, these are
included in the recommendations where relevant. For all other risk factors, the
recommendations would be the same for people with possible symptoms of cancer,
irrespective of whether they had a risk factor. However, an exception was made to include
asbestos exposure in the recommendations because of the high relative risk of
mesothelioma in people who have been exposed to asbestos.

# Update information

**May 2025:** We amended recommendations 1.2.1 and 1.2.7 to recommend a suspected cancer referral for people with symptoms indicating a 3% or more probability of having oesophageal or stomach cancer (rather than an urgent, direct access referral for an endoscopy). We have made these changes following stakeholder feedback. The tables of symptoms have also been updated to reflect these changes.

**April 2025:** We amended the recommendations on blood tests for myeloma in response to a series of NHS England National cancer programme reviews looking at opportunities for earlier diagnosis, including for myeloma. The tables of symptoms and primary care investigation findings have also been updated to reflect these changes. Amended recommendations are marked [2015, amended 2025].

**October 2023:** We updated the definition of suspected cancer pathway referral in line with NHS England's standard on faster diagnosis of cancer.

**August 2023:** We updated the recommendations on criteria for faecal testing and referral for suspected colorectal cancer in line with NICE's diagnostics guidance on quantitative faecal immunochemical testing to guide colorectal cancer pathway referral in primary care. The tables of symptoms and primary care investigation findings have been updated to reflect these changes. New and amended recommendations are marked [2023] or [2015 amended 2023].

**December 2021:** We reviewed the evidence on fixed and age-adjusted thresholds for PSA testing and updated recommendation 1.6.3.

**January 2021:** We amended the recommendations in the section on colorectal cancer to include the full list of criteria for faecal testing.

**September 2020:** We amended the recommendations in the section on colorectal cancer to clarify when to offer faecal testing for colorectal cancer to adults without rectal bleeding.

**July 2017:** Recommendation 1.3.4 was replaced by NICE diagnostics guidance on quantitative faecal immunochemical tests to guide referral for colorectal cancer in primary care and other recommendations were amended accordingly. In December 2017, some of
the wording in the section on colorectal cancer was clarified, and the tables on abdominal and pelvic pain, change in bowel habit and primary care investigations updated in line with this.

June 2016: Recommendations in the section on colorectal cancer have been changed to say 'adults' instead of 'people' to more accurately reflect the populations they cover.

June 2015: This guideline updates and replaces NICE guideline CG27 (published June 2005).

Recommendations are marked as [2021], [2020], [2015], [2011], [2011, amended 2020] or [2005]:

- [2021] indicated that the evidence has been reviewed and the recommendation has been updated in 2021.
- [2020] indicates that the evidence has been reviewed and the recommendation has been added or updated in 2020.
- [2011, amended 2020] indicates that the wording has been changed but the evidence has not been reviewed since 2020.
- [2015], [2005] or [2011] indicates the date that the evidence was last reviewed.

Minor changes since publication

March 2024: In recommendation 1.12.2 and the table on symptoms in children and young people, we changed absent red reflex to absent fundal ('red') reflex. See the surveillance report for more information.

October 2021: In recommendation 1.12.2 we added a cross-reference to NICE's guideline on suspected neurological conditions for advice for children who have new-onset squint with an absent fundal 'red' reflex. See the surveillance report for more information. We also added a link to NICE's guideline on babies, children and young people's experience of healthcare in the sections on childhood cancers and symptoms in children and young people.
