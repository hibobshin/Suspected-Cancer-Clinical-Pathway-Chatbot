# Your responsibility

The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service. It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.

All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.

Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be inconsistent with complying with those duties.

Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

This guideline replaces CG27.

This guideline partially replaces CG122.

This guideline is partially replaced by HTG690.

This guideline is the basis of QS96, QS124, QS130, QS203 and QS90.

This guideline should be read in conjunction with QS155.

# Overview

This guideline covers identifying children, young people and adults with symptoms that could be caused by cancer. It outlines appropriate investigations in primary care, and selection of people to refer for a specialist opinion. It aims to help people understand what to expect if they have symptoms that may suggest cancer.

We have used the terms 'men' and 'women' in some recommendations on gender-related cancers, but they also apply to people who have changed or are in the process of changing gender, and who retain the relevant organs.

## Who is it for?

* Healthcare professionals
* People involved in clinical governance in both primary and secondary care
* People with suspected cancer and their families and/or carers.
# Introduction

## Safeguarding children

Remember that child maltreatment:

* is common
* can present anywhere
* may co-exist with other health problems, including suspected cancer.

See NICE's guideline on child maltreatment for clinical features that may be associated with maltreatment.

> People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your care.
>
> Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the strength (or certainty) of our recommendations (although this may not apply to recommendations made before 2009; see the section on recommendation wording in guideline updates below). It also has information about prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards and laws (including on consent and mental capacity) and safeguarding.

## How the guideline is organised

The recommendations in this guideline have been organised into 3 separate sections to help healthcare professionals find the relevant information easily. The recommendations for investigation and referral organised by site of suspected cancer are also presented in tables of recommendations organised by symptoms and investigation findings. Either section should be used in conjunction with the recommendations on patient support, safety netting and the diagnostic process.
## Recommendation wording in guideline updates

NICE began using standard wording to denote the strength of recommendations in guidelines that started development after January 2009. It does not apply to any recommendations ending [2005] (see update information for details about how recommendations are labelled). In particular, for recommendations labelled [2005] the word 'consider' may not necessarily be used to denote the strength of the recommendation.
# Recommendations organised by site of cancer

> Use this guideline to guide referrals. If still uncertain about whether a referral is needed, consider contacting a specialist (see the recommendations on the diagnostic process). Consider a review for people with any symptom associated with increased cancer risk who do not meet the criteria for referral or investigative action (see the recommendations on safety netting).

## 1.1 Lung and pleural cancers

### Lung cancer

## 1.3 Lower gastrointestinal tract cancers

### Colorectal cancer

> Recommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.4 are adapted from NICE's diagnostics guidance on quantitative faecal immunochemical testing to guide colorectal cancer pathway referral in primary care.

1.3.1 Offer quantitative faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) using HM-JACKarc or OC-Sensor to guide referral for suspected colorectal cancer in adults:
* with an abdominal mass or
* with a change in bowel habit or
* with iron-deficiency anaemia or
* aged 40 and over with unexplained weight loss and abdominal pain or
* aged under 50 with rectal bleeding and either of the following unexplained symptoms:
    - abdominal pain
    - weight loss or
* aged 50 and over with any of the following unexplained symptoms:
    - rectal bleeding
    - abdominal pain
    - weight loss or
* aged 60 and over with anaemia even in the absence of iron deficiency.

FIT should be offered even if the person has previously had a negative FIT result through the [NHS bowel cancer screening programme](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bowel-cancer-screening/). People with a rectal mass, an unexplained anal mass or unexplained anal ulceration do not need to be offered FIT before referral is considered. [2023]

1.3.2 Refer adults using a suspected cancer pathway referral for colorectal cancer if they have a FIT result of at least 10 micrograms of haemoglobin per gram of faeces. [2023]

1.3.3 For people who have not returned a faecal sample or who have a FIT result below 10 micrograms of haemoglobin per gram of faeces:
* safety netting processes should be in place
* referral to an appropriate secondary care pathway should not be delayed if there is strong clinical concern of cancer because of ongoing unexplained symptoms (for example, abdominal mass). [2023]

1.3.4 Clinicians should consider if people need additional help, information or support to return their sample. [2023]

1.3.5 Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for colorectal cancer in adults with a rectal mass. [2015, amended 2023]

### Anal cancer

1.3.6 Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for anal cancer in people with an unexplained anal mass or unexplained anal ulceration. [2015]

## 1.4 Breast cancer

1.4.1 Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral for breast cancer if they are:
* aged 30 and over and have an unexplained breast lump with or without pain or
* aged 50 and over with any of the following symptoms in one nipple only:
    - discharge
    - retraction
    - other changes of concern. [2015]

1.4.2 Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for breast cancer in people:
* with skin changes that suggest breast cancer or
* aged 30 and over with an unexplained lump in the axilla. [2015]

1.4.3 Consider non-urgent referral in people aged under 30 with an unexplained breast lump with or without pain. See also recommendations 1.16.2 and 1.16.3 for information about seeking specialist advice. [2015]

## 1.5 Gynaecological cancers

### Ovarian cancer

The recommendations in this section have been incorporated from [NICE's guideline on ovarian cancer](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg122) and have not been updated. The recommendations for ovarian cancer apply to women aged 18 and over.

1.5.1 Make a referral to a gynaecological cancer service using a suspected cancer pathway referral if physical examination identifies ascites and/or a pelvic or abdominal mass (which is not obviously uterine fibroids). [2011, amended 2020]

1.5.2 Carry out tests in primary care (see recommendations 1.5.6 to 1.5.9) if a woman (especially if aged 50 or over) reports having any of the following symptoms on a persistent or frequent basis – particularly more than 12 times per month:
* persistent abdominal distension (women often refer to this as 'bloating')
* feeling full (early satiety) and/or loss of appetite
* pelvic or abdominal pain
* increased urinary urgency and/or frequency. [2011]

1.5.3 Consider carrying out tests in primary care (see recommendations 1.5.6 to 1.5.9) if a woman reports unexplained weight loss, fatigue or changes in bowel habit. [2011]

1.5.4 Advise any woman who is not suspected of having ovarian cancer to return to her GP if her symptoms become more frequent and/or persistent. [2011]

1.5.5 Carry out appropriate tests for ovarian cancer (see recommendations 1.5.6 to 1.5.9) in any woman aged 50 or over who has experienced symptoms within the last 12 months that suggest irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), because IBS rarely presents for the first time in women of this age. (See NICE's guideline on irritable bowel syndrome in adults). [2011]

1.5.6 Measure serum CA125 in primary care in women with symptoms that suggest ovarian cancer (see recommendations 1.5.1 to 1.5.5). [2011]

1.5.7 If serum CA125 is 35 IU/ml or greater, arrange an ultrasound scan of the abdomen and pelvis. [2011]

1.5.8 If the ultrasound suggests ovarian cancer, make a referral to a gynaecological cancer service using a _suspected cancer pathway referral_. [2011, amended 2020]

1.5.9 For any woman who has normal serum CA125 (less than 35 IU/ml), or CA125 of 35 IU/ml or greater but a normal ultrasound:
* assess her carefully for other clinical causes of her symptoms and investigate if appropriate
* if no other clinical cause is apparent, advise her to return to her GP if her symptoms become more frequent and/or persistent. [2011]

### Endometrial cancer

1.5.10 Refer women using a _suspected cancer pathway referral_ for endometrial cancer if they are aged 55 and over with post-menopausal bleeding (unexplained vaginal bleeding more than 12 months after menstruation has stopped because of the menopause). [2015]

1.5.11 Consider a _suspected cancer pathway referral_ for endometrial cancer in women aged under 55 with post-menopausal bleeding. [2015]

1.5.12 Consider a _direct access ultrasound scan_ to assess for endometrial cancer in women aged 55 and over with:
* unexplained symptoms of vaginal discharge who:
    - are presenting with these symptoms for the first time or
    - have thrombocytosis or
    - report haematuria or
* visible haematuria and:
    - low haemoglobin levels or
    - thrombocytosis or
    - high blood glucose levels. [2015]

### Cervical cancer

1.5.13 Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for women if, on examination, the appearance of their cervix is consistent with cervical cancer. [2015]

### Vulval cancer

1.5.14 Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for vulval cancer in women with an unexplained vulval lump, ulceration or bleeding. [2015]

### Vaginal cancer

1.5.15 Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for vaginal cancer in women with an unexplained palpable mass in or at the entrance to the vagina. [2015]

## 1.6 Urological cancers

### Prostate cancer

1.6.1 Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral for prostate cancer if their prostate feels malignant on digital rectal examination. [2015]

1.6.2 Consider a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal examination to assess for prostate cancer in people with:
* any lower urinary tract symptoms, such as nocturia, urinary frequency, hesitancy, urgency or retention or
* erectile dysfunction or
* visible haematuria. [2015]

1.6.3 Consider referring people with possible symptoms of prostate cancer, as specified in recommendation 1.6.2, using a suspected cancer pathway referral for prostate cancer if their PSA levels are above the threshold for their age in table 1. Take into account the person's preferences and any comorbidities when making the decision. [2021]

(Typical features of basal cell carcinoma include: an ulcer with a raised rolled edge; prominent fine blood vessels around a lesion; or a nodule on the skin [particularly pearly or waxy nodules].) [2015]

1.7.6 Only consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for people with a skin lesion that raises the suspicion of a basal cell carcinoma if there is particular concern that a delay may have a significant impact, because of factors such as lesion site or size. [2015]

1.7.7 Follow NICE's guidance on improving outcomes for people with skin tumours including melanoma for advice on who should excise suspected basal cell carcinomas. [2015]

## 1.8 Head and neck cancers

### Laryngeal cancer

### Retinoblastoma

1.12.2 Consider referral for ophthalmological assessment using a suspected cancer pathway referral for retinoblastoma in children with an absent fundal ('red') reflex. If there is new-onset squint that occurs together with an absent fundal ('red') reflex, see the recommendation on new-onset squint with loss of fundal 'red' reflex in NICE's guideline on suspected neurological conditions. [2015]

### Wilms' tumour

1.12.3 Consider very urgent referral (for an appointment within 48 hours) for specialist assessment for Wilms' tumour in children with any of the following:

## 1.13 Non-site-specific symptoms

Some symptoms or symptom combinations may be features of several different cancers. For some of these symptoms, the risk for each individual cancer may be low but the total risk of cancer of any type may be higher. This section includes recommendations for these symptoms.

### Symptoms of concern in children and young people

1.13.1 Take into account the insight and knowledge of parents and carers when considering making a referral for suspected cancer in a child or young person. Consider referral for children if their parent or carer has persistent concern or anxiety about the child's symptoms, even if the symptoms are most likely to have a benign cause. [2015]

### Symptoms of concern in adults

1.13.2 For people with unexplained weight loss, which is a symptom of several cancers including colorectal, gastro-oesophageal, lung, prostate, pancreatic and urological cancer:
* carry out an assessment for additional symptoms, signs or findings that may help to clarify which cancer is most likely and
* offer urgent investigation or a suspected cancer pathway referral. [2015]

1.13.3 For people with unexplained appetite loss, which is a symptom of several cancers including lung, oesophageal, stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, bladder and renal cancer:
* carry out an assessment for additional symptoms, signs or findings that may help to clarify which cancer is most likely and
* offer urgent investigation or a suspected cancer pathway referral. [2015]

1.13.4 For people with deep vein thrombosis, which is associated with several cancers including urogenital, breast, colorectal and lung cancer:
* carry out an assessment for additional symptoms, signs or findings that may help to clarify which cancer is most likely and
* consider urgent investigation or a suspected cancer pathway referral. [2015]
# Recommendations on patient support, safety netting and the diagnostic process

> Use this guideline to guide referrals. If still uncertain about whether a referral is needed, consider contacting a specialist (see the recommendations on the diagnostic process). Consider a review for people with any symptom associated with increased cancer risk who do not meet the criteria for referral or investigative action (see the recommendations on safety netting).

## 1.14 Patient information and support

1.14.1 Discuss with people with suspected cancer (and their carers, as appropriate, taking account of the need for confidentiality) their preferences for being involved in decision-making about referral options and further investigations including their potential risks and benefits. [2015]

1.14.2 When cancer is suspected in a child, discuss the referral decision and information to be given to the child with the parents or carers (and the child if appropriate). [2015]

1.14.3 Explain to people who are being referred with suspected cancer that they are being referred to a cancer service. Reassure them, as appropriate, that most people referred will not have a diagnosis of cancer, and discuss alternative diagnoses with them. [2015]

1.14.4 Give the person information on the possible diagnosis (both benign and malignant) in accordance with their wishes for information (see also NICE's guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services). [2015]

1.14.5 The information given to people with suspected cancer and their families and/or carers should cover, among other issues:
* where the person is being referred to
* how long they will have to wait for the appointment
* how to obtain further information about the type of cancer suspected or help before the specialist appointment
* what to expect from the service the person will be attending
* what type of tests may be carried out, and what will happen during diagnostic procedures
* how long it will take to get a diagnosis or test results
* whether they can take someone with them to the appointment
* who to contact if they do not receive confirmation of an appointment
* other sources of support. [2015]

1.14.6 Provide information that is appropriate for the person in terms of language, ability and culture, recognising the potential for different cultural meanings associated with the possibility of cancer. [2015]

1.14.7 Have information available in a variety of formats on both local and national sources of information and support for people who are being referred with suspected cancer. For more information on information sharing, see the section on enabling patients to actively participate in their care in NICE's guideline on patient experience in adult NHS services. [2015]

1.14.8 Reassure people in the safety netting group (see recommendation 1.15.2) who are concerned that they may have cancer that with their current symptoms their risk of having cancer is low. [2015]

1.14.9 Explain to people who are being offered safety netting (see recommendation 1.15.2) which symptoms to look out for and when they should return for re-evaluation. It may be appropriate to provide written information. [2015]

1.14.10 When referring a person with suspected cancer to a specialist service, assess their need for continuing support while waiting for their referral appointment. This
should include inviting the person to contact their healthcare professional again if they have more concerns or questions before they see a specialist. [2005]

1.14.11 If the person has additional support needs because of their personal circumstances, inform the specialist (with the person's agreement). [2005]

## 1.15 Safety netting

1.15.1 Ensure that the results of investigations are reviewed and acted upon appropriately, with the healthcare professional who ordered the investigation taking or explicitly passing on responsibility for this. Be aware of the possibility of false-negative results for chest X-rays and tests for occult blood in faeces. [2015]

1.15.2 Consider a review for people with any symptom that is associated with an increased risk of cancer, but who do not meet the criteria for referral or other investigative action. The review may be:
* planned within a time frame agreed with the person or
* patient-initiated if new symptoms develop, the person continues to be concerned, or their symptoms recur, persist or worsen. [2015]

## 1.16 The diagnostic process

1.16.1 Take part in continuing education, peer review and other activities to improve and maintain clinical consulting, reasoning and diagnostic skills, in order to identify at an early stage people who may have cancer, and to communicate the possibility of cancer to the person. [2005]

1.16.2 Discussion with a specialist (for example, by telephone or email) should be considered if there is uncertainty about the interpretation of symptoms and signs, and whether a referral is needed. This may also enable the primary healthcare professional to communicate their concerns and a sense of urgency to secondary healthcare professionals when symptoms are not classical. [2005]
1.16.3 Put in place local arrangements to ensure that letters about non-urgent referrals are assessed by the specialist, so that the person can be seen more urgently if necessary. [**2005**]

1.16.4 Put in place local arrangements to ensure that there is a maximum waiting period for non-urgent referrals, in accordance with national targets and local arrangements. [**2005**]

1.16.5 Ensure local arrangements are in place to identify people who miss their appointments so that they can be followed up. [**2005**]

1.16.6 Include all appropriate information in referral correspondence, including whether the referral is urgent or non-urgent. [**2005**]

1.16.7 Use local referral proformas if these are in use. [**2005**]

1.16.8 Once the decision to refer has been made, make sure that the referral is made within 1 working day. [**2005**]
# Recommendations organised by symptom and findings of primary care investigations

The recommendations in this section are displayed alphabetically by symptom then in order of urgency of the action needed, to make sure that the most urgent actions are not missed. Where there are several recommendations relating to the same cancer these have been grouped for ease of reference. Occasionally the same symptom may suggest more than 1 cancer site. In such instances, the recommendations are displayed together and the GP should use their clinical judgement to decide on the most appropriate action.

> Use this guideline to guide referrals. If still uncertain about whether a referral is needed, consider contacting a specialist (see the recommendations on the diagnostic process). Consider a review for people with any symptom associated with increased cancer risk who do not meet the criteria for referral or investigative action (see the recommendations on safety netting).

## Young people

Aged 16 to 24 years.

# Recommendations for research

The guideline committee has made the following recommendations for research.

## Key recommendations for research

**1 Age thresholds in cancer**

Longitudinal studies should be carried out to identify and quantify factors in adults that are associated with development of specific cancers at a younger age than the norm. They should be designed to inform age thresholds in clinical guidance. The primary outcome should be likelihood ratios and positive predictive values for cancer occurring in younger age groups.

**2 Primary care testing**

Diagnostic accuracy studies of tests accessible to primary care should be carried out for a given cancer in symptomatic people. Priority areas for research should include tests for people with cough, non-visible haematuria, suspected prostate cancer, suspected pancreatic cancer, suspected cancer in childhood and young people and other suspected rare cancers. Outcomes of interest are the performance characteristics of the test, particularly sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values.

**3 Cancers insufficiently researched in primary care**

Observational studies of symptomatic primary care patients should be used to estimate the positive predictive value of different symptoms for specific cancers. Priority areas for research are those where the evidence base is currently insufficient and should include prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, cancer in childhood and young people and other rare cancers. Outcomes of interest are positive predictive values and likelihood ratios for cancer.

**4 Patient experience**

Qualitative studies are needed to assess the key issues in patient experience and patient
information needs in the cancer diagnostic pathway, particularly in the interval between first presentation to primary care and first appointment in secondary care. Outcomes of interest are patient satisfaction, quality of life and patient perception of the quality of care and information.

**5 Prostate-specific antigen testing**

What is the diagnostic accuracy of using age-adjusted and fixed prostate-specific antigen thresholds for people with symptoms of prostate cancer, including those at high risk of developing prostate cancer (such as those with an African family background or a family history of prostate cancer)?

> For a short explanation of why the committee made the recommendation for research see the rationale section on prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer.
>
> Full details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are in evidence review A: PSA testing for prostate cancer.
# Rationale and impact

This section briefly explains why the committee made the recommendation and how it might affect practice.

## Prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer

Recommendation 1.6.3

### Why the committee made the recommendation

The evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of fixed and age-specific prostate-specific antigen (PSA) thresholds was very uncertain because all of the studies were based on a population that had already been referred to secondary care. The 2019 guideline recommended referral if PSA levels were above the age-specific reference range. The committee agreed that referral should be considered based on PSA thresholds, but did not make a stronger recommendation because of the uncertainty in the evidence and the likely low positive predictive value of the PSA test for prevalence estimates based on UK population data. The committee noted that many prostate cancers are slow growing and might never impact a person's life expectancy. Some people might choose not to be referred to secondary care to avoid invasive investigations and treatment that might not benefit them. Therefore, the committee agreed that a patient-centred approach to referral is important, and recommended that the person's preferences and any comorbidities should be taken into account.

The committee agreed that more research is needed in this area to better understand the most appropriate thresholds that should prompt referral to secondary care for each age group. The committee noted that ethnicity and family history are important factors that affect the risk of prostate cancer. Therefore, they recommended that the data from research be stratified by these factors to determine whether different PSA levels should prompt referral in these groups. Research in this area may also help to address health inequalities in prostate cancer diagnosis and outcomes in the UK.

There was no strong evidence to differentiate between using age-specific or fixed PSA
thresholds. The committee also noted that no cost-effectiveness evidence comparing age-specific thresholds with fixed thresholds was identified. However, because PSA levels increase naturally with age, the committee agreed a lower fixed PSA threshold would detect more cases of prostate cancer but also lead to unnecessary biopsies and overtreatment in some age groups. This would also be likely to result in more referrals to secondary care and have a significant impact on NHS resources. The committee therefore recommended the use of age-specific thresholds, which are already established in current practice and were recommended in the previous version of the guideline. Because of regional variations in practice (particularly in the 50 to 69 age range), the committee decided to define the age-specific PSA thresholds. The committee agreed that the thresholds used in the reviewed studies on people with symptoms of possible prostate cancer should be used in the absence of evidence to support alternative values, because these studies were most applicable to the population that the recommendation applies to. No evidence was available specifically for people under 40 or over 79, and so the committee recommended that clinical judgement is used when deciding whether to refer people in these groups to secondary care.

## How the recommendation might affect practice

Referral based on age-specific PSA thresholds is already recommended, so practice should not change significantly. Also, clarifying the age-specific thresholds will help standardise care. Taking into account patient preferences and comorbidities should also lead to a more patient-centred approach to referral.

# Context

Cancer has an enormous impact, both in terms of the number of people affected by it and the individual impact it has on people with cancer and those close to them. More than 300,000 new cancers (excluding skin cancers) are diagnosed annually in the UK, across over 200 different cancer types. Each of these cancer types has different presenting features, though they sometimes overlap. Approximately one-third of the population will develop a cancer in their lifetime. There is considerable variation in referral and testing for possible cancer, which cannot be fully explained by variation in the population.

The identification of people with possible cancer usually happens in primary care, because most people first present to a primary care clinician. Therefore, evidence from primary care should inform the identification process and was used as the basis for this guideline.

The recommendations were developed using a 'risk threshold', whereby if the risk of symptoms being caused by cancer is above a certain level, then action (investigation or referral) is warranted. The positive predictive value (PPV) was used to determine the threshold. In the previous guideline, a disparate range of percentage risks of cancer was used to form the recommendations. Few corresponded with a PPV of lower than 5%. The guideline development group (GDG) felt that, in order to improve diagnosis of cancer, a PPV threshold lower than 5% was preferable. Taking into account the financial and clinical costs of broadening the recommendations, the GDG agreed to use a 3% PPV threshold value to underpin the recommendations for suspected cancer pathway referrals and urgent direct access investigations, such as brain scanning or endoscopy. Certain exceptions to a 3% PPV threshold were agreed. Recommendations were made for children and young people at below the 3% PPV threshold, although no explicit threshold value was set. The threshold was not applied to recommendations relating to tests routinely available in primary care (including blood tests such as prostate-specific antigen and imaging such as chest X-ray), primary care tests that could be used in place of specialist referral, non-urgent direct access tests and routine referrals for specialist opinion. Further information about the methods used to underpin the recommendations can be found in the full guideline.

It is well recognised that some risk factors increase the chance of a person developing cancer in the future, for example, increasing age and a family history of cancer. However, risk factors do not affect the way in which cancer presents. Of the risk factors that were reported in the evidence, only smoking (in lung cancer) and age were found to significantly
influence the chance of symptoms being predictive of cancer. Therefore, these are included in the recommendations where relevant. For all other risk factors, the recommendations would be the same for people with possible symptoms of cancer, irrespective of whether they had a risk factor. However, an exception was made to include asbestos exposure in the recommendations because of the high relative risk of mesothelioma in people who have been exposed to asbestos.

# Update information

May 2025: We amended recommendations 1.2.1 and 1.2.7 to recommend a suspected cancer referral for people with symptoms indicating a 3% or more probability of having oesophageal or stomach cancer (rather than an urgent, direct access referral for an endoscopy). We have made these changes following stakeholder feedback. The tables of symptoms have also been updated to reflect these changes.

April 2025: We amended the recommendations on blood tests for myeloma in response to a series of NHS England National cancer programme reviews looking at opportunities for earlier diagnosis, including for myeloma. The tables of symptoms and primary care investigation findings have also been updated to reflect these changes. Amended recommendations are marked **[2015, amended 2025]**.

October 2023: We updated the definition of suspected cancer pathway referral in line with NHS England's standard on faster diagnosis of cancer.

August 2023: We updated the recommendations on criteria for faecal testing and referral for suspected colorectal cancer in line with NICE's diagnostics guidance on quantitative faecal immunochemical testing to guide colorectal cancer pathway referral in primary care. The tables of symptoms and primary care investigation findings have been updated to reflect these changes. New and amended recommendations are marked **[2023]** or **[2015 amended 2023]**.

December 2021: We reviewed the evidence on fixed and age-adjusted thresholds for PSA testing and updated recommendation 1.6.3.

January 2021: We amended the recommendations in the section on colorectal cancer to include the full list of criteria for faecal testing.

September 2020: We amended the recommendations in the section on colorectal cancer to clarify when to offer faecal testing for colorectal cancer to adults without rectal bleeding.

July 2017: Recommendation 1.3.4 was replaced by NICE diagnostics guidance on quantitative faecal immunochemical tests to guide referral for colorectal cancer in primary care and other recommendations were amended accordingly. In December 2017, some of
the wording in the section on colorectal cancer was clarified, and the tables on abdominal and pelvic pain, change in bowel habit and primary care investigations updated in line with this.

June 2016: Recommendations in the section on colorectal cancer have been changed to say 'adults' instead of 'people' to more accurately reflect the populations they cover.

June 2015: This guideline updates and replaces NICE guideline CG27 (published June 2005).

Recommendations are marked as [2021], [2020], [2015], [2011], [2011, amended 2020] or [2005]:
* [2021] indicated that the evidence has been reviewed and the recommendation has been updated in 2021.
* [2020] indicates that the evidence has been reviewed and the recommendation has been added or updated in 2020.
* [2011, amended 2020] indicates that the wording has been changed but the evidence has not been reviewed since 2020.
* [2015], [2005] or [2011] indicates the date that the evidence was last reviewed.

## Minor changes since publication

March 2024: In recommendation 1.12.2 and the table on symptoms in children and young people, we changed absent red reflex to absent fundal ('red') reflex. See the surveillance report for more information.

October 2021: In recommendation 1.12.2 we added a cross-reference to NICE's guideline on suspected neurological conditions for advice for children who have new-onset squint with an absent fundal 'red' reflex. See the surveillance report for more information. We also added a link to NICE's guideline on babies, children and young people's experience of healthcare in the sections on childhood cancers and symptoms in children and young people.
